# Coding Exam

Exam specific for Knoose. 

## Pre-requisite
- Node.js
- Any IDE or code editor such as _Visual Studio_

To run them, simply run the commands below:
- `node coding_assessment_1.js`
- `node coding_assessment_2.js`
- `node coding_assessment_3.js`

### Coding Assessment 1
- Imported module; module is used to read user input
- User's input is passed as an argument to the callback function
- Inside the callback function, for loop is used to iterate from 1 to _n_
- Check  the current number _i_ is divisible by 5 and 7, 5 only, or 7 only using the modulo operator (%)
- Print the result accordingly

### Coding Assessment 2
- Imported module; module is used to read user input
- User's input is passed as an argument to the callback function
- Inside the callback function, nested loop is used
- First or outer loop iterates from 0 to _n-1_
- Second or inner loop prints the appropriate number of - and * characters

### Coding Assessment 3
- Simple sorting algorithm 
- Nested loop is used
- First or outer loop iterates from 0 to _array length_
- Second or inner loop iterates the next index of _i_
- Condition checks if index of _i_ value is greater or less than the index value of _j_ (which is the next index)
- If yes, it stores the value to the temp variable then replaces it to the next variable
